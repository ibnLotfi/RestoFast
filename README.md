## RestoFast
1. In the first time, I will just create the Back-office side of the project, and the client-side after.
2. Then, I will take car about Authentication for the Back-office side.
3. I will provide the pay interface, for complete all the purchasing process.
4. Enhance the design and provide the Css's.

## 1 First Part of the Project
I will not take care about the design and the Css, because I am basecally a Back end Developper, and I want not to be lost in learning a great number of tutorials and the I risk to giving up the intial project.
